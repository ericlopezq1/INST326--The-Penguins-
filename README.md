# INST326--The-Penguins-
Save The Penguin, the game, is a Python program that runs on Pygame through the use of three main classes, each with its respective sets of around eight methods.

The overall game mechanics of the game are that the user controls the penguin class character, which is movable with the user’s arrow keys. The user (penguin) must avoid collision with ships that decrease the penguin’s health. The premise of this game came to be from inspiration from the Pokémon battle game program earlier this semester that had a similar script structure.

Our classes after several iterations in development are class Penguin, class Ships, and class Game. Each class works together to run on a single command line under the if name == "main": statement.


Team 6
Nice readme about the project overview; however, make sure to also include more details about each class and each function before the submission this Sunday
Also make sure to include how to run the program once you are finished so I can recreate it and don’t forget about the video submission as well
I also took a look at your code and it looks great with the 3 classes and functions inside of them… is the code all completed or is there still stuff that needs to be added? 
Have you started the testing requirements like doing the pytest?
Keep in mind the submission is due this sunday so make sure you have all your final changes and edits pushed onto Github by Sunday night  as well as upload your recorded video onto that google drive link I posted on the annoucements
