# INST326--The-Penguins-
Save The Penguin, the game, is a Python program that runs on Pygame through the use of three main classes, each with its respective sets of around eight methods.

The overall game mechanics of the game are that the user controls the penguin class character, which is movable with the user’s arrow keys. The user (penguin) must avoid collision with ships that decrease the penguin’s health. The premise of this game came to be from inspiration from the Pokémon battle game program earlier this semester that had a similar script structure.

Our classes after several iterations in development are class Penguin, class Ships, and class Game. Each class works together to run on a single command line under the if name == "main": statement.
